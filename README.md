# Track My Time Usage

> I took inspiration for this application from one of Ankur Warikoo's strategies for measuring and increasing effective time usage.


This app is being developed with the true purpose to measure your `time efficiency`.
The effective time usage in a 14hr slot all through the day. Here, you are given an input box to grade your time usage for every hour of the day. 

`Efficiency = SUM(Eff. Every Hour)/14`

Since, efficiency cannot be 100% every hour, I have introduced a bias factor of `1` per hour.
